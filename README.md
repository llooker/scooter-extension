# Looker Extension Hello World (React & JavaScript)

This example has been adopted from the extension-examples helloworld example.

## Getting Started for Development

1. Clone this repo.

   ```
   # cd ~/ Optional, your user directory is usually a good place to git clone to.
   git@github.com:llooker/scooter-extension.git
   ```

2. Navigate (`cd`) to the scooter-extension directory on your system

   ```
   cd query-builder-ef
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```
   yarn develop
   ```

   The extension is now running and serving the JavaScript locally at http://localhost:8080/bundle.js.
